this was a website made following another tutorial on Youtube that I did on the porpuse of practicing html and css the most I could that way to better understand it's use in practice rather than theory

### Hero section & navbar

On the Hero section, we've created a simple catching CTA model. The CTA button itself has an animation where every time you hover over its color changes to a certain blue from left to right.
The sign up button on the navbar also changes color to that blue but it changes with a ease aspect rather than an animation

The menu items change from white to a certain red when hovering it too with a easy-out effect.

### Footer

The footer is a simple footer made using flexbox with flex direction to be columns.

There's also two cards that grows in size when hovering over.
